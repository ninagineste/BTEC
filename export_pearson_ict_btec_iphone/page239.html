High-level programs have much clearer structures when repeating code or making decisions.</p><p>Low-level programs usually have a very large number of lines of code because each instruction only does a small action, so it can be difficult to see the overall structure among so much detail.</p><p>This section will discuss the characteristics of high-level and low-level programming.</p></div>

In this type of code, each program statement is a step towards handling the inputs, processing and outputs.</li><li><strong>Procedural programs.</strong> These have definite start and end points. These languages were normal before GUI operating systems, as they usually have a single starting point then follow a sequence. Modern programs respond to events so can have many start points within the code.</li><li><strong>Event-driven programs.</strong> These respond to events such as a mouse click. These are the current approach for modern programming because they need to produce responses to the great variety of events that GUI operating systems provide.</li><li><strong>Object-orientated programs (OOP)</strong>. These view programs as a collection of objects, such as a database record, and not as a list of tasks as in procedural programming. Each object can be viewed as an independent &lsquo;machine&rsquo; with a distinct role or responsibility, which is capable of receiving messages, processing data and sending messages to other objects. These concepts are difficult to understand without more experience and they are not covered within the <em>BTEC First in Information and Creative Technology</em> course.</li></ul></root></div>
