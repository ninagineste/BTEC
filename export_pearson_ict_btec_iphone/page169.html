In my second year I could pick specialist options, and I chose Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I became fascinated by this developing area, from the design aspects to the psychology and science behind it, and I felt that this was a field in which I could carve out a&nbsp;career.</p><p>My first job was a junior designer within a large team of software designers. At first, I was given fairly small tasks, including roughing out designs, which more experienced designers would develop. Gradually, more interesting and technical work began to come my way. I had an interest in designing system interfaces for users, and my manager spotted that I had a talent for this and encouraged this specialism.</p><p>Initially, my work dealt with websites, but gradually I became involved in more general software interfaces. Currently, I&rsquo;m involved with designing HCIs for people with various disabilities, using different types of hardware and software. HCI technology is a huge field and the ever-expanding range of hardware (e.g. smartphones and tablets) and disciplines makes it extremely exciting. Part of what I do involves translating computer sensible information into human sensible information, and the reverse.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to be receptive to new things and to have an aptitude for innovative design. You have to be able to look at a problem and ask questions about how people work, what the computer needs, and how best to provide the environment for both to talk to each other.</p><p>There are great opportunities in this field to be involved in pioneering, cutting edge work and also to progress your career and develop your skills and knowledge base.</p><div class="think" data-id="3530"><h4>Think about it:</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjE2Ni4xNjkuOTYzLjM1MzAuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTM1MzA=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjE2Ni4xNjkuOTYzLjM1MzAuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTM1MzA="><root><ol><li>What is HCI?</li><li>What skills and characteristics do you think are needed for this type of job?</li><li>Consider all of the computer applications you use.
