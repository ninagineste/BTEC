Your first task is to identify the intended purpose of the website, the target audience and their requirements. If you are working to a client brief then you must read it carefully and ensure that all the details are clear. If they are not, you must clarify them with the client. If you are creating a website for yourself, then write down a clear statement of its purpose and the requirements of the intended audience.</p><div class="Fact_Box" data-id="8855"><h4>Did you know?</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzQuODg1NS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODg1NQ==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzQuODg1NS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODg1NQ=="><p>Several professionals might be involved in creating a website. A web developer will do the technical parts of designing the site. A separate content manager will be responsible for keeping the content up to date. There might also be an SEO (search engine optimisation) specialist whose job it is to encourage user traffic to the site from internet search engines.</p></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="8864"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzQuODg2NC44ODY2Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODg2Ng==">Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of a website may be stated as a problem it is intended to solve. This might be something like &lsquo;our high street shop sales are falling and we want a website to enable us to sell items online&rsquo; or &lsquo;our rock band isn&rsquo;t as popular as we think it should be, so we want to promote ourselves and increase record sales in Europe and across the world&rsquo;.

Consider, for example:</p><root><ul><li>Will users have to register to see the site&rsquo;s content?</li><li>Will users be purchasing items from the site?</li><li>Will users want to be able to search the content of the site? Will users want to be able to feed back comments to the site, interact with one another through a forum or link to social networking sites?</li><li>It is important to understand your audience (users) and what type of functionality and features they will need &ndash; and possibly expect &ndash; the site to have.</li></ul></root><p>The user requirements might include the sort of language you use (for example, formal or informal, technical language or a more straightforward level of English), the colours and font styles you choose and the images and other media (such as videos) you include.</p><div class="activity" data-id="9992"><h4>Activity 13.3</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzQuODg3NC45OTkyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05OTky" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzQuODg3NC45OTkyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05OTky"><p>What sort of features would appeal to a target audience of students of your own age studying at school?

Instead, it is a cycle in which you think up ideas, try them out and refine them, rejecting some ideas and developing others.</p><div class="remember" data-id="9042"><h4>Remember</h4><p>You should look for inspiration on existing websites that you like the design of.

As well as defining text formatting, styles can also define page layouts and paragraph formatting, such as text and image alignment and spacing.

A&nbsp;storyboard is a multi-panel drawing or diagram of your website, showing its content and structure. You can draw storyboards by hand or using a computer.</p><p>Storyboards should be annotated to show the formatting being used for each element of your page (i.e. colours, fonts, sizes) and explain where hyperlinks will take the user. Assets such as photos or animations should be linked to the asset list by their asset number. Your storyboards don&rsquo;t have to show the actual assets and text content of your pages; you can use dummy content which you replace with the real content when you actually develop the pages.</p><div class="link" data-id="9382"><h4>Link</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzYuOTExMi45MzgyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05Mzgy" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzYuOTExMi45MzgyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05Mzgy"><p>Refer to <em><ref refto="unit3"><display>Unit 3 A digital portfolio</display></ref></em>, for further information on storyboards, home pages and folder structures.</p></div></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="9116"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzYuOTExNi45MTE3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtOTExNw==">Asset list</h3><p>Your storyboards should enable you to list all the different digital assets you will need to complete the web pages you are designing. Digital assets can include things like images or diagrams, videos, animations and audio. You will need to create some of these yourself and others will be ready-made (for example, Clip Art). Your asset list is a list of everything you need and where you plan to get it from. You must document and reference the sources of any ready-made assets so that you know where they came from and can seek permission to use them. Your asset list can be used as a check list as you gather the assets during your construction of the site.</p><div class="Checklist" data-id="9795"><h4>Just checking</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzYuOTExNi45Nzk1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05Nzk1" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTgxNC4xODE2LjQ3NzYuOTExNi45Nzk1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS05Nzk1"><root><ol><li>What is the purpose of a site map?</li><li>What is CSS used for?</li><li>What information should you include in your asset list?</li></ol></root></div></div></div></div>

You can create simple web pages by entering the HTML codes in a text editor like Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Notepad<sup>&reg;</sup>. However, professional web developers use more sophisticated tools like Dreamweaver<sup>&reg;</sup> to create pages. You will also need additional software to edit image files and may need software to create and edit animations, sound and video files. To create images and video, you will need a digital camera. If you want to digitise existing artwork, you will need a scanner.</p></div>

However, these documents are designed to be printed on paper, a process which will probably be controlled by you.</p><p>A website is fundamentally different in that it needs to be designed so it can be viewed by people anywhere in the world, using quite a wide range of different hardware and software over which you have no control. For instance, you don&rsquo;t know what screen size people viewing your website have (it can be anything from a very small screen on a mobile phone to a large monitor), you don&rsquo;t know what operating system they are using (it might be an Apple<sup>&reg;</sup> Mac<sup>&reg;</sup>, a Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> PC or a PC running Linux<sup>&reg;</sup>) and you don&rsquo;t know what web browser they are using.</p><div class="remember" data-id="7789"><h4>Remember</h4><p>You don&rsquo;t know which web browser visitors to your website will be using. It could be Microsoft&reg; Internet Explorer&reg;, Google<sup>&trade;</sup> Chrome<sup>&trade;</sup>, Firefox&reg; or another browser, and you won&rsquo;t know which version of the browser they have installed.</p></div><p>All of these issues make developing a website more complex than you might first imagine.</p><p>Some features you might want to include in your website may require plug-ins to be loaded in the viewer&rsquo;s browser. For example, to play an animation created in Adobe&reg; Flash&reg;, the viewer must have the Flash&reg; plug-in loaded. This may not be the case for every user as not all platforms support Flash&reg; (Apple<sup>&trade;</sup> software, for example, doesn&rsquo;t). Some users might consider certain plug-ins (such as Active-X) as a security risk and might not load them. Because all users will have different hardware and software constraints, it&rsquo;s a good idea not to over-complicate your web pages and to work to the assumption that all users&rsquo; systems are quite basic.</p></div>
