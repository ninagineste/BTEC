This stage is just as important as the design stage, as you will need to evaluate your work and compare it against the original requirements. It is suitable for the target audience? Does it meet its original purpose? Is it of a high enough quality?</p><p>Reviewing your own work can be hard, so it is a good idea to ask others for their feedback. This can be very useful, as you will gain an understanding of how people engage with the product. It will also help you understand where improvements need to be made and what you could do better next time round.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="5947"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNC41OTQ3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01OTQ3" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNC41OTQ3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01OTQ3"><p>In small groups, discuss what you think is meant by &lsquo;the review stage&rsquo;.</p></div></div></div>

You can&rsquo;t expect to produce material of a professional quality, but comparing your audio products against professional products can help you identify their strengths and weaknesses. When reviewing the quality, be sure to consider:</li><li>how good your recordings are (Is there any background noise? Can the people speaking be clearly heard? etc.)</li><li>how well your different assets are edited together (Are the sound levels good? Is the timing good with no long pauses? etc.).</li></ul></root></div><div class="level3" data-id="5513"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNi41NTEzLjU1MTUuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC01NTE1">Fitness for audience and purpose</h3><p>How well do your final products match their original purpose?

Be prepared to explain why they occurred.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5524"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNi41NTI0LjU1MjUuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC01NTI1">Legal and ethical constraints</h3><p>The reviewing stage should not just focus on how well your audio products function and meet their purpose. You should also consider the wider processes involved in creating the products, and where you sourced assets from. When reviewing your products from a legal and ethical constraints position, be sure to ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>Did copyright constraints prevent you from using some assets you would have liked to use?</li><li>Did you consider general safety issues, such as taking care with downloads to avoid viruses? Did you observe health and safety precautions, such as taking regular breaks when using the computer and keeping food and drinks away?</li><li>Did you take regular backups of your work?</li><li>Is the content suitable? For example, is it likely to cause offence to anyone? Does it contain any personal information?</li></ul></root></div><div class="level3" data-id="5535"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNi41NTM1LjU1MzYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC01NTM2">Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p>It is a hard skill to assess your own strengths and weaknesses, but it is a good exercise to do when reviewing your work and the processes involved in creating it. When reviewing your strengths and weaknesses, be sure to ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>What was really good about your audio products?</li><li>How might you further develop them if you had more time?</li><li>How would you do things differently next time to avoid the problems you encountered?</li></ul></root><div class="assessment_activity" data-id="8473"><h4>Assessment activity 5.5/1C.6/2C.P6/2C.M5/2C.D4</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNi41NTM1Ljg0NzMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTg0NzM=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc5Mi43OTMuMjMwNi41NTM1Ljg0NzMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTg0NzM="><p>You now need to review and evaluate your podcasts.
