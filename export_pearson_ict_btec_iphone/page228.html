Each piece of content should include an introduction to explain what it is and why you have included it. The introduction should lead your audience into the content by including the reasons the work was undertaken, and which of your characteristics it demonstrates.</p><p>In addition to introductions, you may need to add some text to provide a link between the various pieces of work included.</p></div>

The images you select must add something extra to the text, or provide further explanation or clarification of the text. You could also include an image used as a logo to help give a consistent look and feel to the presentation of your portfolio.</p><p>You may need to write captions for some of the images used to make sure that they fully explain the text.</p><div class="remember" data-id="4924"><h4>Remember</h4><p>You will have done the work you include in your portfolio to satisfy various marking and grading criteria within the syllabus. You will probably have done it to fit a scenario or to answer a question set by your teacher. The&nbsp;audience for your portfolio will not necessarily have access to this information and so you will have to provide a commentary describing the things you have included and giving reasons why you have included them.</p></div></div>

They have to add something special to the rest of the content, or demonstrate something that the text and images on the web page cannot.</p><p>As your portfolio is in support of an application, you might choose to include audio or video of a presentation that you have given to demonstrate your presentation skills. (The ability to present and effectively communicate information is highly valued by employers, and are key skills that they look for.)</p><p>If you include audio files, you could also look at including a transcript (a written version of what is contained in the audio file). An audio file will give your audience an idea of your expressiveness when speaking to people.</p><p>Video will show not only your vocal control, but also your body language during a presentation. You could also include video of you performing a practical activity to demonstrate your practical skills.</p><p>While audio and video clips are very useful, you should not include too many. If you are going to use more than one clip, you should make sure they are varied to prevent them from becoming monotonous.</p></div>

They can also add to the consistent image that you want to portray in your portfolio.</p><p>You can use simple shapes such as rectangles to produce text boxes for highlighting specific pieces of text. You can use lines as dividers to separate different types of information in your text.</p></div>

It needs to be consistent and made easy for users, so that they are able to easily spot hyperlinks within different sections of your portfolio. To provide consistency across your portfolio, you should aim to apply the same style and positioning of hyperlinks across your portfolio. For example, have all text hyperlinks the same colour and have the navigation bar in the same location on each of your pages.</p></div>

Navigation bars take up room and may, therefore, limit the space available for you to place your actual content. It is usual practice for every navigation bar to have at least one link to take users to the level above, as well as ones to the levels below. Normally, there is also a link that takes users to the home page.</p><div class="activity" data-id="4377"><h4>Activity 3.6</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjIyNS4yMjguMTU1OS40Mzc3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00Mzc3" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjIyNS4yMjguMTU1OS40Mzc3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00Mzc3"><span data-type="xref"><root><p>Using some of the templates you created in <ref data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMTA1MTYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRccmVmZXJlbmNlLTEwNTE2" data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjIxMS4yMTMuMTY2My41MTk3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MTk3" data-type="activity"><text>Activity 3.5</text></ref>, create a few sample web pages that include a number of the page content features covered in this section.</p></root></span><span data-type="xref"><root><p>Keep notes of what you have done and save the pages you create, as they may be useful for <ref data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMTA1MTcuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRccmVmZXJlbmNlLTEwNTE3" data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjI0MC4yNDMuMTQwNC40ODEwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00ODEw" data-type="assessment_activity"><text>Assessment activity 3.3</text></ref>.</p></root></span></div></div></div>
