This section looks at the six areas that you need to cover when you review your finished software program.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="9127"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwMDUuOTEyNy4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTEyNw==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwMDUuOTEyNy4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTEyNw=="><p>Can you remember the last time you reviewed a product or service by giving feedback or completing a questionnaire? In pairs, discuss the type of feedback you provided, and if you felt your comments would help improve the product or service. For example, giving feedback on the features of a computer game.</p></div></div></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="4010"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwMTAuNDAxMi4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTQwMTI=">User requirements</h2><p>The user requirements are a list of objectives that the user wants your software program to deliver. The final software program may not necessarily match all of those requirements, perhaps as a result of constraints. In your review, you need to state which of the requirements have not been covered and the reasons why. For example:</p><root><p><em>&lsquo;I have not been able to include a function that allows users to save information to a file because security restrictions on the computer system prevented me from doing this.&rsquo;</em></p></root><p>It is also good practice to highlight all the requirements you have met.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="4028"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwMjguNDAzMS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTQwMzE=">Fitness for purpose</h2><p>In your review, you need to think about whether your finished software program does what it is meant to do. This might be, for example, adding two numbers together and displaying the result.</p><p>If it meets its intended purpose, explain how. If it doesn&rsquo;t, set out the reasons why not and describe the changes you could make to fulfil the original client brief.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="4041"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwNDEuNDA0NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTQwNDQ=">User experience</h2><p>It is important that your software program meets the user requirements and purpose. However, another important aspect to review is the user experience. You should therefore obtain feedback from the people who are actually going to be using the program. Check whether or not the program is easy to navigate and whether it performs in the way the users expect.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="4049"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjIxNC4yMTguMTE5My4xMTk0LjQwNDkuNDA1MC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTQwNTA=">Constraints</h2><p>Programmers are always faced with challenges. Many of these are to do with constraints of the programming language, the timeframe in which software programs must be developed and limited access to device capabilities. This part of the review is where you have the opportunity to talk about the challenges you have encountered, and how you have overcome them. Sometimes constraints are unavoidable, and alternative solutions need to be found.</p></div>
