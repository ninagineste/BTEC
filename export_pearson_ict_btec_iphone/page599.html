No business wants important documents or sensitive data to fall into the hands of its competitors. One way to make sure that authorised users only can access data on the network and other resources such as the internet, printers, scanners, and so on, is for employees to input a personal identity (ID) and password at login.

For example, when you use your school network, you may have a personal folder in which to store your work, and a shared folder in which your teacher puts documents to be accessed by the whole class. You may be able to email other students and teachers, and have access to the internet, but there are also areas which the network does not permit you to access, for example other students&rsquo; personal folders, the school&rsquo;s administration, certain websites, and so on. These are the services of the network, and they can be tailored to meet the needs of individual users.</p><div class="level3" data-id="6996"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNTk3LjU5OS4yNTUzLjY5OTYuNjk5Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTY5OTc=">Network system login</h3><p>When you login to your school&rsquo;s network, it&rsquo;s likely the first thing you do is to input your ID and a password.

This person is known as the network administrator, and in many organisations they are responsible for controlling what individual users can or cannot do when they login to the system. This is referred to as account management &ndash; every user on the network has an account which sets out what they are allowed to do on the network.</p><p>The network administrator can use account management software to set up a group on the network. The group may consist of users working in the same department who need access to each others&rsquo; documents and data, or users across the organisation working together on a particular project. A user can be set as a group on the network, and account management software will be used to control the group settings. Any changes to these settings will apply instantly to all users in the group.</p><div class="Fact_Box" data-id="8734"><h4>Did you know?</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNTk3LjU5OS4yNTUzLjcwMDYuODczNC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODczNA==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNTk3LjU5OS4yNTUzLjcwMDYuODczNC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODczNA=="><p>Different users in different groups could believe they use a totally different network because the network services respond to their logins to provide their individual network environments.</p></div></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="7008"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNTk3LjU5OS4yNTUzLjcwMDguNzAwOS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTcwMDk=">File and folder permissions</h3><p>On your school network, you will be permitted to open some folders and use the files inside them.

A network is rather like a sports and leisure club &ndash; it&rsquo;s only open to members, and non-members may not use its facilities.

Supermarkets, computer manufacturers, airlines, football clubs, health centres, construction companies, phone providers and call centres, all use networks for different purposes. A great feature of networks is that they can be set up to suit the needs of the organisation. A network may consist of individual users, and as we saw earlier, users can be linked together to form groups of users.
