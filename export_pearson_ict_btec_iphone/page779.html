It&rsquo;s a fascinating job in general, but even more so for someone like me who is interested in history and enjoys a challenge!</p><p>The museum has a large collection of historical audio recordings, all of which are held on a variety of analogue media, such as gramophone records, reel-to-reel tapes and cassette tapes. Some of the very old recordings were made on wax cylinders and magnetic wires. Most of these recordings are in such poor condition that they will soon decay to the point where we can no longer save them.</p><p>Because some of the tapes are in such poor physical condition (due to age, dust and mould), they have to be cleaned up before we can even try to play them. I have a range of analogue playback equipment connected to my computer, including reel-to-reel and cassette tape players and gramophone turntables. Once I have converted the recording to digital format, I then have to adjust the recording to achieve the best possible result. I also have to update the file&rsquo;s metadata and add in details of what the recording is and when it was made. This enables historians to search for information relevant to their research.</p><p>Some of the material is really fascinating. The project I&rsquo;m currently working on involves the recollections of a solider from World War I, recorded on a gramophone record in the 1920s, shortly after the war ended.</p><div class="think" data-id="6771"><h4>Think about it</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3OC43NzkuMjQ0Mi42NzcxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS02Nzcx" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3OC43NzkuMjQ0Mi42NzcxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS02Nzcx"><root><ol><li>What sort of skills (both technical and other skills) do you think Sally needs to do her job?</li><li>What challenges does she face in her day-to-day work?</li><li>What do you think she likes best about her job?</li></ol></root></div></div></div></div>
