In the process of designing your digital video product, you will need to create a number of different design documents.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="4895"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQyNy40ODk1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00ODk1" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQyNy40ODk1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00ODk1"><p>Having an idea may be the most difficult step in creating an original video. Discuss all ideas with your peers and try to get as much feedback as possible to help guide your ideas and designs.</p></div></div></div>

Who are you making the video for? What age group or gender is your video aimed at? Are you trying to attract people with a specific interest e.g. skiing or animal welfare?</p><p>Without a clear idea of how your audience is and their wants and needs, your video will probably not appeal to anyone and will not be fit for purpose. When producing your design brief, you should consider the intended age, gender and interests of your audience and think about where they will be watching your video. For example, a video that is to be shown to young adults in a cinema will need a different approach to a video shown to young children to introduce them to an online educational game.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="1441"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQ0MS4xNDQ0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtMTQ0NA==">Initial design ideas</h2><p>You should brainstorm your initial design ideas with your team, perhaps using a spider diagram. Then you can group ideas into categories, such as ideas relating to the purpose and audience, the technical features of the video, the plot and characters, etc. Once you have done this, you can cut down your ideas until you have something you are happy with and can put the purpose and requirements of your video in a design brief.</p><p>You may wish to create a simplified version of your design idea that you can show to a test audience to get their reaction and feedback. This is known as prototyping. Your prototype could be an animated storyboard or a video recording produced without the technical care and consideration that you would use for your final video product. Prototyping gives you a valuable opportunity to make sure that your design idea:</p><root><ul><li>can be produced within the constraints of your project</li><li>is of interest to the intended audience and fit for purpose.</li></ul></root><div class="remember" data-id="4153"><h4>Remember</h4><p>Working in teams, every member should have a chance to be involved in the development of the idea. You should look to get the best out of every member in your team by sharing and discussing ideas.</p></div></div>

Your script should detail what will be included in the video product: the sequence of events as well as the dialogue. Any instructions for the director, actors or support team should be clearly indicated, as should all movements (stage directions), effects and the changing of scenery.</p><div class="take_it_further" data-id="4347"><h4>Take it further</h4><p>It is worth looking at a professional script before you start your own. Look at the layout and how certain elements (such as instructions and stage directions) are labelled in a very particular way, using a key.</p></div><p>You should aim to make your final script as accurate as you can before recording it. However, you will need to continually review and update your script during filming. After a filmshoot a producer&rsquo;s script will be full of pencil notes and changes.</p></div>

A storyboard provides a visual explanation of the video using a series of drawings with plenty of written notes and details about the key aspects of the individual clips. The storyboard should cover these elements:</p><root><ul><li><strong>characters</strong> &ndash; the actors that appear within each scene</li><li><strong>scenery</strong> &ndash; the imagery that appears behind the characters and key objects</li><li><strong>props</strong> &ndash; the key objects and assets within the scene, including furniture, everyday objects and tools (e.g. the murder weapon in a crime thriller is a key object)</li><li><strong>timing</strong> &ndash; when certain events will happen within the sequence of footage and how long each camera angle or scene will be</li><li><strong>camera angles</strong> &ndash; how the cameras are to be positioned for each scene in relation to actors, scenery and props</li><li><strong>FX</strong> &ndash; any sound or video effects that are added to a scene.</li></ul></root><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQ0OC40MzA5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MzA5" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQ0OC40MzA5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MzA5"><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzMy41MzQuMTQ0OC40MzA5LjQzMTIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC00MzEy" data-ref="true" title="An example storyboard " data-copyright="Pearson Education Ltd" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Pearson Education Ltd</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><p>Figure 7.2</p></span><div class="caption"><p>An example storyboard</p></div></span></div><p>You can use a storyboard as a way of sorting your ideas and getting a clearer idea of what you need to gather together and prepare for the project, including props, assets including those or which you will need to get permission to use and talent (actors and support staff).
