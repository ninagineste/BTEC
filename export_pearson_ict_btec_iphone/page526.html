It is important to ensure that you understand your audience: their age, gender and interests. By understanding your audience&rsquo;s needs, you can target a digital video at that audience to produce the effect you are looking for.</p><p>Some videos evoke emotion, while others are meant to educate, entertain or inform their audience. An ineffective video might bore an audience or leave them confused. In contrast, a poor-quality video might get a positive response, even though it lacks the quality of a big-budget movie.</p><p>Purpose and effect are very closely linked. The purpose of a video is what you want to achieve by creating it, while the effect is how the audience react to the video. If the purpose of a video is to make the audience laugh and the effect it has on them is to make them cry, the video has not succeeded in its purpose, but the effect is still the effect.</p><p>Effect can be influenced by the platform that the video is watched on. For example, the experience of watching a horror file in a cinema may make it more effective, while watching an online promotional video is likely to be more direct and personal to an individual.</p><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUyNC41MjYuMjQ0NC42MjU4Ljk0MTQuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk0MTQ=" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUyNC41MjYuMjQ0NC42MjU4Ljk0MTQuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk0MTQ="><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUyNC41MjYuMjQ0NC42MjU4Ljk0MTQuOTQxNi4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTk0MTY=" data-ref="true" title="Watching a film in 3D can enhance the effect of action and scenery on the audience " data-copyright="Veer (Corbis) / Deklofenak" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Veer (Corbis) / Deklofenak</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><content></content></span><div class="caption"><p>Watching a film in 3D can enhance the effect of action and scenery on the audience</p></div></span></div><div class="discussion_activity" data-id="9439"><h4>Discussion point</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUyNC41MjYuMjQ0NC42MjU4Ljk0MzkuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk0Mzk=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUyNC41MjYuMjQ0NC42MjU4Ljk0MzkuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk0Mzk="><root><p><strong>The move away from premium quality</strong></p></root><p>There are several examples of television shows and films for which the director has chosen to shoot video so it appears informal, amateurish or even low quality.
