Reviewing involves taking a critical look at what you have produced and comparing it to what you expected to produce, as well as what your audience actually needed. Reviewing is an extremely difficult skill that is usually only fully developed after many years of practice. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea to start practising your reviewing skills at every level of your work.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="2850"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjI2OC4yNzEuMTEyNy4yODUwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0yODUw" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjI2OC4yNzEuMTEyNy4yODUwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0yODUw"><p>When you get to the end of a project, it can be very hard to review your own work objectively.

One method could be a questionnaire. This method supports continuity as a questionnaire will contain pre-determined questions - meaning that all test users will be asked the same questions.</p><p>You should use the feedback to explain how your portfolio meets the needs of the intended audience and purpose, and it will help you make recommendations for further improvement.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="3711"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU1LjU2LjI2OC4yNzEuMTEzMy4zNzExLjM3MTIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC0zNzEy">Suggested improvements</h3><p>At the end of the review you should be in a position to suggest some further improvements to the portfolio. You should justify why each improvement is needed. Remember &ndash; you don&rsquo;t need to implement the recommendations, but it is important to record them.
