                                                            <p>Digital graphics are images and/or text created on or scanned into a computer. Graphics are used to communicate messages in every part of our lives, including advertising, music, fashion, interior design and architecture. You will see them when you surf websites, play computer games, go shopping or read a user manual. They bring colour, information and interest to our lives.</p>
                                                            <p>Have you ever thought about how graphics are created? Who has designed them and who are they aimed at? When graphic designers are creating graphic products, they have to take into account the audience and purpose of their work. Are the graphics helping to promote retirement homes to older people or a new style of trainers to teenagers? How a graphic designer plans and designs a graphic will very much depend on what impact the graphic needs to make and who it is aimed at.</p>
                                                            <p>Most graphic products are made by using photo-editing and vector-editing tools and techniques on ready-made or original images. In this unit, you will investigate a range of applications and features of graphic products and consider their audience and purpose. You will be able to apply what you discover to your own digital graphic products.</p>
                                                            <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> You will be assessed by a series of assignments set by your teacher.</p>

Using my graphics skills, I was able to design a series of promotional materials to help raise awareness. These were placed around the school and helped to make sure that the fundraising events were well advertised and well attended. The events were a great success and we raised lots of money!</p><p>Tom, 16-year-old would-be graphic developer</p><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQyMC40MjEuMjA4NC41MjcwLjk4NTIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk4NTI=" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQyMC40MjEuMjA4NC41MjcwLjk4NTIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTk4NTI="><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQyMC40MjEuMjA4NC41MjcwLjk4NTIuOTg1NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTk4NTQ=" data-ref="true" title=" " data-copyright="Pearson Education Ltd / Jules Selmes" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Pearson Education Ltd / Jules Selmes</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><content></content></span><div class="caption"><content></content></div></span></div></div></div></div>
