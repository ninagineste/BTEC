This will include gathering feedback, making final improvements and documenting any changes.</p></div>

You can judge the quality of your software applications using a number of different criteria.</p><div class="level3" data-id="5467"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0NjcuNTQ2OC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU0Njg=">Efficiency/performance</h3><p>Your mobile app will use a certain amount of the system resources available (processor time, memory space, accessing storage media). You need it to use as little of these as possible so it will work effectively on the hardware being used. Designing your processing in detail can help to create the most efficient program code possible. You will have clearly thought through what needs to happen and can use this to produce the final code.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5474"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0NzQuNTQ3NS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU0NzU=">Maintainability</h3><p>At a later date, you may need to make modifications to the program to correct problems, improve the efficiency or add new functionality. By annotating the code and breaking it down into well-designed subroutines, you will make the program easier to maintain.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5483"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0ODMuNTQ4Ni4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU0ODY=">Portability</h3><p>You will need your app to run on as many different hardware and operating system platforms as possible. This may require you to code the program in several different languages. It is much easier to do this if you have fully designed your code before implementing it.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5494"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuNTQ5NS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU0OTU=">Usability</h3><p>Your app needs to be as easy to use as possible. If the program is too complex to actually use, then the app cannot be considered a success. By carefully designing your user interface and navigation, and by discussing your design with your client before implementing it, you can be sure that the app will be usable by your target audience.</p><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuOTc0NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTc0NA==" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuOTc0NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTc0NA=="><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuOTc0NC45NzQ3Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtOTc0Nw==" data-ref="true" title="You need to make sure your app can run on different computer operating systems " data-copyright="Pearson Education Ltd" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Pearson Education Ltd</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><p>Figure 8.16</p></span><div class="caption"><p>You need to make sure your app can run on different computer operating systems</p></div></span></div><div class="activity" data-id="9767"><h4>Activity 8.9</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuOTc2Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTc2Nw==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjc2LjY3Ny4yMjQ5LjU0OTQuOTc2Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtOTc2Nw=="><root><ol><li>In groups, choose a mobile app and review it against the quality criteria explained in this section.
