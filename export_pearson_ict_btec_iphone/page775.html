These will allow you to check that the microphone is picking up the sound correctly and that there is not too much background noise. Headphones that fully cover your ears are the best choice, as they help cut out external sounds so you can concentrate on the sound picked up by the microphone. You should not try to monitor the recording you are making by listening to it on speakers, as this will interfere with the recording (and may cause feedback).

Equipment used for recording or playing back human speech only (with no music) can have a much narrower range of frequency response, as speech is normally only within the range of about 200 Hz to 8 KHz. Equipment that will be used to record or play back music needs a wider frequency response, in line with what humans can actually hear.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8306"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMwNy44MzA2LjgzMDguLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC04MzA4">Other things to consider</h3><p>Other aspects of recording and playback equipment you need to consider include:</p><root><ul><li><strong>Cost.</strong> You do not need to obtain a lot of expensive equipment, but really cheap microphones may not produce very good results.</li><li><strong>Length of cord.</strong> If you purchase a microphone, it will probably come with quite a short lead, which can make it inconvenient to use.

Make sure any equipment with rechargeable batteries (laptop, mobile phone) is fully charged up and you have spare batteries for any equipment that uses replaceable batteries.</p><div class="level3" data-id="8384"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg0LjgzODYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC04Mzg2">Soundchecks</h3><p>Before you start recording, you should carry out a soundcheck. This involves setting up all your equipment (laptop or other recording equipment, microphone, etc.) and making a short test recording. Ideally, your test recording should be with the same actors&rsquo; voices as you will be using for the real recording and should be in the same location.</p><p>Once you have made your test recording, play it back and check that everything is as it should be. In particular, check that the actors&rsquo; voices are clearly audible and that there is no background noise or other unwanted noises.</p><div class="remember" data-id="9073"><h4>Remember</h4><p>Although you can make some adjustments to the recording after it has been made, it is wise to start off with the best possible recording. It is very difficult and time-consuming (and may not always be possible) to adjust a poor recording to achieve something that is of an acceptable quality.</p></div><p>If the results of the soundcheck are not acceptable or you think you can improve on them, make whatever adjustments are necessary and do another soundcheck. You might find you need to adjust the position of the microphone, adjust the recorder settings or move to a different location to achieve better results.</p><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg0LjkwODMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTkwODM=" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg0LjkwODMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTkwODM="><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg0LjkwODMuOTA4Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTkwODc=" data-ref="true" title="Preparing for your recording will help ensure that everything goes smoothly " data-copyright="Pearson Education Ltd / Martin Beddall" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Pearson Education Ltd / Martin Beddall</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><content></content></span><div class="caption"><p>Preparing for your recording will help ensure that everything goes smoothly</p></div></span></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="8387"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg3LjgzODguLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC04Mzg4">Audio recording set-up</h3><p>Once the soundcheck is complete, you can make the actual recording. Professionals often need several &lsquo;takes&rsquo; in order to get it right, so don&rsquo;t be concerned if it does not go well the first time. Listen to the recording as soon as you have made it to ensure it is of the required standard. Don&rsquo;t delete any recordings at this stage, as you may be able to use the better parts of an otherwise poor recording at the editing stage. If you have any doubts, try the recording again. It far better to have several good recordings to choose from than to have just one that is not really good enough.</p><div class="activity" data-id="10364"><h4>Activity 5.6</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg3LjEwMzY0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0xMDM2NA==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjYzLjY0Ljc3NC43NzUuMzMxMS44Mzg3LjEwMzY0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0xMDM2NA=="><p>Check out your equipment by doing a soundcheck.
