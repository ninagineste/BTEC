In some cases, such as the animations used in films for special effects, they are designed to appear to be real live action rather than an animation.</p></div>

The most obvious is in the creation of animations for entertainment.</p><div class="level3" data-id="4201"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAxLjQyMDIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC00MjAy">Some uses for animation</h3><p>Children&rsquo;s cartoons for television and full-length animated feature films may be the first use that you think of. However, animation is often used in adverts and in music videos. It is also used to create simulations, such as what happens during an earthquake or how a spacecraft will land on Mars.</p><div class="Fact_Box" data-id="9309"><h4>Did you know?</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAxLjkzMDkuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTkzMDk=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAxLjkzMDkuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTkzMDk="><p>You can watch an animation of the way the Mars spacecraft Curiosity was expected to land on the planet. Using the internet, go to YouTube and search for &lsquo;<strong>Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover Animation</strong> &rsquo;. This project was launched in 2011 and Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012.</p></div></div><p>Animations are widely used on the internet and for mobile content, ranging from simple animations to liven up web pages to the complex animations used in games.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="4203"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAzLjQyMDQuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC00MjA0">Creating effects</h3><p>Animation can be used to create scenes that would be impossible, very difficult or very expensive to reproduce with live action. For example, it can be used to produce monsters, aliens or animals that can talk.</p><p>Animation can be used to create an atmosphere or mood in a film that cannot easily be produced with live action. Children&rsquo;s cartoons, for example, can have a silly, crazy feel that is exciting, fast moving and totally unrealistic. This may include animals or inanimate objects (such as cars or trains) that have human features and characteristics and may involve them interacting with real humans.</p><p>Animations can also show how something works (or will work) more clearly than could be done with words or still images (for example the Mars landing animation). This is called a simulation.</p><p>Animation may be aimed at many different types of audience. It can be used to make people laugh, make them sad, educate them or to produce many other effects. When designing an animation product, you will need to consider who the audience is and what kind of effect you want to have on them.</p><div class="activity" data-id="7962"><h4>Activity 4.2</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAzLjc5NjIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTc5NjI=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMyOS4zMzAuMTIxNy40MjAzLjc5NjIuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTc5NjI="><p>Imagine you are considering making a short animated film.
