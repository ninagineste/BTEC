In this section we will look at the things you need to consider during the review stage.</p><p>You can evaluate your digital video product in terms of the constraints you had to work within when you created it.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="1882"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjYxNC42MTUuMTg4Mi4xODg1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtMTg4NQ==">Quality</h2><p>The quality of your video will depend on where you plan to publish it. If it needs to be high-quality then all aspects of your video must be consistently well-presented, without pixelation or colour issues. Reduced-quality videos are more forgiving, but consistency is still key and any changes in ratio or resolution will be very noticeable.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="1893"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjYxNC42MTUuMTg5My4xODk2Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtMTg5Ng==">Suitability</h2><p>When reviewing your product, ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>Is your video fit for purpose and audience? Does your video meet the needs of the brief you were working to?</li><li>Have you included all of the required content originally asked for by the client or set by yourself and your team?</li></ul></root><p>If the client has very specific targets, then your video must reflect these. Your video may be entertaining, but if it does not have a clear purpose, then it does not meet the targets you identified within the early stages of the project.</p><p>Also, consider the response of your audience, and use the feedback they provided to support your answer.</p></div>
                                                            <div class="level2" data-id="1918"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjYxNC42MTUuMTkxOC4xOTIwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtMTkyMA==">Legal and ethical constraints</h2><p>A constraint is anything that prevents you making the exact product you want, to the highest possible standard.</p><p>The three main influences (and possibly constraints) on the success of your project are:</p><root><ul><li><strong>Technical constraints</strong>: your personal skill and knowledge of digital video productions</li><li><strong>Editing constraints</strong>: the limitations of the available technology</li><li><strong>Personnel constraints</strong>: the limitations of working within a team.</li></ul></root><p>In addition, you should review your video under the legal conditions that affect all creative media products. Have you infringed any copyright laws? You should be particularly careful with your screen captures. You must also be careful with any delicate or unsuitable content. Even if they are your main subject, you need to be sensitive in how you present them</p></div>

Ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>are there any faults in your video?</li><li>are all cuts and transitions appropriate and used correctly?</li><li>are the levels of speech at the correct level?</li><li>are there any technical errors that need correcting?</li></ul></root><p>If you have used a combination of original and unusual editing styles, try to be objective about whether or not this approach has worked. While it&rsquo;s great to be creative and try new things, you need to make sure that the audience can follow and understand what is happening.</p><p>Changing the cuts, transitions, sounds and music to alter the pace or feel of a video is normal within an edit, so state what you changed and what effect these had on the piece. Again, refer to your audience&rsquo;s response: if they did not react as you wished, you may have had to re-edit your video to get the desired reaction.</p><div class="assessment_activity" data-id="5340"><h4>Assessment activity 7.6/1C.6/2C.P6/2C.M5/2C.D4</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjYxNC42MTUuMTk0OS41MzQwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MzQw" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjYxNC42MTUuMTk0OS41MzQwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MzQw"><p>Parton Publishing Enterprises would like you to produce a report on your finished video product.</p><p>Create an illustrated report which includes:</p><root><ul><li>a review of the extent to which the final video product satisfies the brief and meets the needs of the audience.
