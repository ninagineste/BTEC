You will need to check each page carefully to see if every element on the page is as it should be.</li></ul></root><div class="remember" data-id="9924"><h4>Remember</h4><p>You should try out the pages using at least two different web browsers, and preferably more.</p></div></div>

Ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>Does the layout and do your colour schemes have a quality look to them or are they messy with garish, clashing colours?</li><li>Is all the spelling and grammar correct?</li><li>Are the images of good quality (high enough resolution)?</li><li>Does the home page load quickly?</li></ul></root></div>

Other users are more likely to be critical of your site than you are and they may spot things you have not noticed. You need to gather feedback on the following areas:</p><root><ul><li><strong>Content.</strong> Is the content suitable for the site? Is the text free from spelling and grammar errors? Are the images suitable?</li><li><strong>Presentation.</strong> Is the content presented and formatted in a neat and consistent manner? Are the colour schemes complementary or do they clash? Are images and other assets sized and formatted appropriately?</li><li><strong>Usability.</strong> Usability will be extremely important for the intended audience of the website. If possible, ask some people from that group to give you their opinion of the site.</li><li><strong>Performance.</strong> How quickly does the site load? Do images load reasonably quickly or is there a noticeable delay before they load?</li><li><strong>Purpose.</strong> How well does the site meet the purpose that was stated at the design stage?</li></ul></root></div>

For example, have you provided alternative text for all your images, tables and forms? You can also try using a text reader to look at your site to see how easy it is to navigate. Have you enabled users to zoom in and out of the web pages? [add more on zoom features]</p></div>

If you find that digital assets such as images, video or audio clips load too slowly you may need to return to the original files and see what can be done to make them smaller. With images you need to check that their actual size matches the size they will be displayed on the page and that their resolution is not higher than it needs to be. Videos also may need their resolution and size reduced to make the files smaller. Most graphics and video-editing software will allow you to adjust the amount of compression that is applied to the file when it is exported so you may need to increase the amount of compression by adjusting these values.</p><div class="level3" data-id="9289"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTg1Ni4xODU4LjU3NDcuOTI4OS45MjkwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtOTI5MA==">Add dynamic functionality</h3><p>An important way you can refine and improve your website is to add dynamic functionality such as hot spots, rollovers, navigation menus and pop-ups.
