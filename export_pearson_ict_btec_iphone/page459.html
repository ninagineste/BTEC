When I was in primary school I started to play with graphics programs and I used to design labels and posters for the teachers. I studied graphics and IT at GSCE stage and decided to do a National Diploma rather than A-levels, so that I could gain more practical experience in designing and creating graphics.</p><p>While studying for my National Diploma, I worked part time for an advertising agency. After I&rsquo;d completed the Diploma, the company offered me a permanent job with the option to have time off to continue with my studies. Needless to say, I said yes! I&rsquo;m currently taking modules that interest me in the hope of putting together a modular degree.</p><p>My work involves picking up an idea from the advertising team, who also give me an indication of the audience and purpose of the advertising campaign. I run up some designs, which tends to involve storyboards and prototyping. I also sketch out lists of what can be done based on existing assets and what we need to create from scratch. I then collate all of this information and pass it on for feedback. Once the campaign has been finalised, I then start to gather assets, create new material and assemble rushes of near final material. The final stages are quite adrenalin-fuelled, so it&rsquo;s easy to get swept away in the creative excitement and realise you&rsquo;ve worked through lunch!</p><p>Communication is very important, as the wider team needs to be aware of what is happening during the different stages. In addition to the design aspects, I also need to be aware of things like health and safety, equality and diversity issues and so on, and build any requirements into my work.</p><p>The variety in my work seems endless, and every day brings new creative challenges.</p><div class="think" data-id="5720"><h4>Think about it</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ1OC40NTkuMjExMS41NzIwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01NzIw" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ1OC40NTkuMjExMS41NzIwLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01NzIw"><root><ol><li>What skills do you think are necessary to do Cyd&rsquo;s role?</li><li>What type of campaigns do you think advertising agencies create?</li><li>Who are the main people that Cyd works with on a day-to-day basis?</li></ol></root></div></div></div></div>
