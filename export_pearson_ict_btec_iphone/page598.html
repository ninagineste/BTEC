                                                            <p>With smartphones becoming the norm in modern society, people have become increasingly reliant on the mobile apps on their phones. These applications are used for all sorts of purposes, including playing games, reading books, downloading music, browsing the internet, sending emails, watching videos and viewing the stock market. Their popularity has resulted in a huge growth in the number of businesses specialising in the development of mobile apps, and with this growth has come a range of job opportunities. These include creative designers, artists and sound engineers.</p>
                                                            <p>This unit will enable you to learn about mobile apps and to look closely at their purpose, uses and features. You will also cover the mobile app development process, learning about how to design, develop and test an application to meet a specific need. You will not be expected to develop an application by programming it from scratch. However, you will develop an understanding of programming languages and be able to edit pre-existing code. Finally, you will learn how to evaluate the success of your mobile app. You will review its suitability and purpose, and assess how it meets user requirements. After obtaining feedback from others, you will be able to make final refinements to your mobile app.</p>
                                                            <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> You will be assessed by a series of assignments set by your teacher.</p>
