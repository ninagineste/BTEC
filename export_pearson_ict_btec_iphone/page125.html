It&rsquo;s really important that each location is connected so that staff can communicate easily and share information reliably and quickly. We&rsquo;re very proud of our network system as it meets our needs very well, looks professional and our clients find it informative and easy to use.</p><p>Our biggest branch holds details of all the properties we currently have for sale or rent on the main network file server. This information is made available to all other computers on the LAN in this shop and through our WAN to the branches, so agents can show them to clients or make changes.</p><p>The routers all have fast optical broadband connections, giving a very responsive system with little lag in showing photos of our properties. Our routers are configured into a WAN, with each branch able to access information held on our server quickly and securely.</p><p>Digital cameras have had a huge impact on the way property is now bought and sold. This technology instantly transformed the ease and speed of accepting new properties into our portfolio and displaying them on our systems. We like to print paper copies of our properties for branch wall displays, as well as showing them on our website. We also advertise on every house hunting website we know of to reach as many potential clients as possible.</p><p>Our website has a nice, simple form that clients can complete for more information or to arrange a visit to any of the properties. The system looks great, is quick to search and allows potential clients to contact us easily.</p></div></div>
