You will need to develop prototypes, practise techniques and refine aspects of the animation until you arrive at the completed product. Testing and previewing is unlikely to be a single event. You will need to think about this throughout the development process, testing and reviewing parts of your animation early on in the process to decide whether some parts need further work before they are acceptable.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="4491"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjM2NC4zNjUuMTUwNS40NDkxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00NDkx" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjM2NC4zNjUuMTUwNS40NDkxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00NDkx"><p>Think about the different stages you work through when you are creating an animation.

When doing this, ask yourself the following questions:</p><root><ol><li>Does it play properly?</li><li>Is the animation reasonably smooth?</li><li>Does the soundtrack play?</li><li>Is it audible?</li><li>Is it in reasonable synchronisation with the action?</li></ol></root><p>Remember: your animation must be between 30 seconds and two minutes in length.</p></div>

For this, you must return to the original requirements you stated in the design of the animation. You need to consider if what you have produced meets the intended purpose of the animation and if it is likely to appeal to the stated target audience. For example, if your target audience is young children, you need to check that the content of your animation really will appeal to them, and that the language you have used is understandable for your chosen age group.</p></div>

For prototypes, this feedback can be informal. However, for your final version, you must get formal feedback by using either a written questionnaire or audio/video recorded interviews.</p><p>The questions you should ask your reviewers about your final product include:</p><root><ul><li>Will it appeal to its intended audience and how well does it meet their needs? (Make sure you tell your reviewers who your intended audience is.)</li><li>Is the movement of the characters realistic? Are there some parts that are better than others?</li><li>Is the timing of the movement and action appropriate, or do things happen too quickly or too slowly?</li><li>Is the quality of the sound appropriate? Does it synchronise well with the animation?</li></ul></root></div>

The simplest way to do this is to take &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; screenshots.</p></div>

Flash<sup>&reg;</sup> animations are designed to be played using a web browser (such as Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup> or Google Chrome&trade;). So that your animation can be played using a web browser, you need to export it as a SWF file.</p><div class="Fact_Box" data-id="4479"><h4>Did you know?</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjM2NC4zNjUuMTU3NS40NDc5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00NDc5" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjM2NC4zNjUuMTU3NS40NDc5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00NDc5"><p>You can preview your animation from within Flash<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional by choosing the <strong>Control</strong> menu and then selecting <strong>Test Movie</strong> from within the <strong>Test</strong> submenu.
