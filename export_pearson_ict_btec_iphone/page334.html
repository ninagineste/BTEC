I got into animation at school and I went on to study Computer Animation at University, but after I completed my degree it took me almost a year to find a paid job in animation.</p><p>During that time, before I got a paid job, I created a number of showreels (example animations) that showcased my skills. In the end, that is what really helped me get a job. However, I also needed to demonstrate I had very good knowledge and skills in using Flash<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p><p>I spend most of my working hours creating Flash<sup>&reg;</sup> animations for children&rsquo;s TV. I work from rough storyboards that the designers produce. I have to work quickly and accurately, and I need good drawing and design skills. I always have to work to quite tight deadlines, as the TV shows have to be completed and fit into a schedule. If I get behind with anything, I just have to stay late and get the work done!</p><p>The work can be quite tough and some aspects of it can be a bit tedious, but I get a tremendous kick out of seeing animations I have created shown on the TV.</p><p>In the future, I&rsquo;m hoping to progress to become a designer. I&lsquo;ve got some great ideas that I think will make amazing animations.</p><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMzMy4zMzQuMTIxOS40MjI0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MjI0" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMzMy4zMzQuMTIxOS40MjI0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MjI0"><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjU5LjYwLjMzMy4zMzQuMTIxOS40MjI0LjQyMjYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC00MjI2" data-ref="true" title=" " data-copyright="Pearson Education Ltd / Stuart Cox" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Pearson Education Ltd / Stuart Cox</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><content></content></span><div class="caption"><content></content></div></span></div><div class="Audio_Document" data-id="4244">
