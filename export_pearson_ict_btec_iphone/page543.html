The cast are the medium through which you tell your story and communicate it to the audience. Lead actors tend to be given the most dialogue and will likely be on the video more than any other actor.</li><li><strong>Secondary actors</strong> support the lead actor. Their role is to help explain the story, provide support to the lead actor or simply to fill the screen with something more interesting than empty space. Their presence is usually less important to the piece than lead actors.</li><li><strong>Extras</strong> fill screen space and make the scene look more real. For example, a shopping centre would look less realistic without staff and shoppers walking around with shopping bags. Extras tend not to have speaking parts (dialogue), but they will need instruction on what to do and when.</li></ul></root></div>

This<strong></strong>is the person in charge. They have responsibility for deciding how the story is told and presented to the audience, what shots to use and how the piece will &lsquo;feel&rsquo; at the end of the production.</li><li><strong>Producer</strong>. This is the person in charge of organising all of the personnel and resources involved in the project. They also make sure that all other crew members are in the right place at the right time. It is important that this person has strong organisational and communication skills.</li><li><strong>Camera operator/Cinematographer</strong>. This person is in charge of the camera(s) and must be skilled in using them. They provide the technical skills needed to bring the director&rsquo;s instructions to life.</li><li><strong>Sound recordist</strong>. This person focuses only on recording the sound needed for the video and maintaining quality throughout. They will focus on the sounds and background noises within a recording, and they will need to have the skills and knowledge to manage both.</li><li><strong>Lighting technician</strong>. This person will have a similar brief to the sound recordist but with a focus on lighting and light levels. They should be able to add or remove light as the director wishes, and will be able to make decisions on what lighting is needed and what will produce the required effects.</li></ol></root><div class=" portrait"  id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU0Mi41NDMuMjAxMC41MjE0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MjE0" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU0Mi41NDMuMjAxMC41MjE0Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MjE0"><span data-type="xref"><div data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU0Mi41NDMuMjAxMC41MjE0LjUyMTUuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC01MjE1" data-ref="true" title="Video shoots can be exciting, but a successful shoot requires a lot of planning and organisation " data-copyright="Shutterstock.com / Losevsky Photo and Video" data-num=""><img src="media/2e6c8eb96e5bd808fa338d5460db3b57.png" /><div class="copyright"><p>Shutterstock.com / Losevsky Photo and Video</p></div></div><br /><span class="identifier"><content></content></span><div class="caption"><p>Video shoots can be exciting, but a successful shoot requires a lot of planning and organisation</p></div></span></div><div class="assessment_activity" data-id="5231"><h4>Assessment activity 7.3 English/1B.3/2B.P3/2B.M2/2B.D2</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU0Mi41NDMuMjAxMC41MjMxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MjMx" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU0Mi41NDMuMjAxMC41MjMxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01MjMx"><span data-type="xref"><root><p>Parton Publishing Services has looked over your document and they are happy that you understand their requirements.
