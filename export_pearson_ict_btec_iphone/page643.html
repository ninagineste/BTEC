This will ensure that you have a clear idea of what you are creating, so that you do not continually change things or add new features during the development. In this section, we will look at what you need to do in the first stage of the design process.</p><div class="starter_activity" data-id="6303"><h4>Getting started</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjQxLjY0My4yNjY3LjYzMDMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTYzMDM=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjQxLjY0My4yNjY3LjYzMDMuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTYzMDM="><p>What do you think makes an app successful? Think about any apps you have downloaded. Why did you download them? Is the user interface successful? What do you like and dislike about how the app has been designed? The Google&trade; Play store and the iTunes&reg; app store both feature a wide range of apps, and are a good place to research other developers&rsquo; products.</p></div></div></div>

For example, it could be to give directions to restaurants, based on the user&rsquo;s GPS position.</p><p>For a mobile app to be successful, it needs to solve an existing problem. You will usually get a range of requirements from the client that the application must meet. It is important to meet these requirements, as they are how your client will judge the success of the app.</p><p>You should also consider your intended audience &ndash; the type of people that you are developing the mobile app for. This audience can be classified in various ways, for example by gender, age group, geographical location or hobbies.</p></div>

These might be from the internet or other media, such as CDs or DVDs.</p><p>It is important to ensure that you have permission to use the code snippets, as otherwise you will be breaching the original programmer&rsquo;s copyright. (This would lead to you having to remove the code and it could also lead to you being sued.)</p><p>You can then edit the code or create code that links to these predefined programs in order to produce your application. You need to collect the predefined programs and create a list of them so that you have a clear understanding of the resources that are available.</p></div>

Be aware that while some will be freely available others may cost a fee. Alternatively, you can create these assets yourself, so that they meet your needs more effectively.</p><div class="remember" data-id="5932"><h4>Remember</h4><p>It is important to respect copyright. Documenting your sources makes it easier to show that you have the right to use these assets. If you feature a company&rsquo;s logo or brand, or music or sound clips from a TV show or film, then you will need to get copyright permission from the owner. While you may be able to find nearly everything on the internet, it does not mean that you have rights to copy it, reproduce it or use it.</p></div><div class="activity" data-id="5938"><h4>Activity 8.5</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjQxLjY0My4yNzQ5LjU5MzguLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTU5Mzg=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjQxLjY0My4yNzQ5LjU5MzguLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTU5Mzg="><p>Use the internet to search for free mobile app graphics.

This will ensure that you give credit to the original creator of the content. You should include all credits in the documentation you create for the mobile app. Documenting the sources will also make it easier to find the content again at a later date if you lose the files.</p></div></div>

Even if you have not created your app yet, you should be able to create a plan that you will be able to use to test your final mobile app. Your test plan will need to include a range of different inputs, and the outputs that you expect as a result. At this stage, you just need to identify what you are testing, what data you will be inputting to test it, and what you expect to happen as a result.</p><p>When compiling your code many errors will be identified by the compilers built in error checker. This will prevent you from being able to actually compile or run the code should there be a glaring programming error.</p></div>
