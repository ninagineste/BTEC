I also wanted to shoot and edit it in an interesting way. The hardest part was deciding what we wanted in the film.</p><p>Our storyboard proved really useful. It helped us as a group work out what we wanted to achieve and let us plan out the footage before we even touched a camera. It also helped us to plan which assets we needed to gather and to identify the starting point for the shot list we created for the shoot.</p><p>The design process made sure we were clear on the technical aspects of the project, such as when we needed specialist kit and where it was to be used. It also allowed us to discuss the sort of film we were making and get all of our ideas out and then get rid of things that seemed to be unnecessary.</p><p>We completed most of the planning documents individually or in pairs. We then came together as a team and compared our work. This ensured continuity across all of our work and helped ensure we were planning the same film and were happy with what we were aiming for. It took a few tries to get everything to match up, but it&rsquo;s very satisfying to know that we&rsquo;re now ready to shoot with every little detailed planned out. Now we can concentrate on capturing the best possible footage.</p><div class="think" data-id="4269"><h4>Think about it</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU1OC41NTkuMTU4NC40MjY5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MjY5" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU1OC41NTkuMTU4NC40MjY5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS00MjY5"><root><ol><li>Why is a storyboard useful when planning a video?</li><li>Why is it important for a film crew to communicate with each other regularly?</li></ol></root></div></div></div></div>
