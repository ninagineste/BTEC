A networked email system has advantages over a stand-alone system. For example, it provides a list of everyone inside the organisation, which is useful when you need to email somebody you have not emailed before. Also there are shared calendars, which can help you to arrange meetings and remind everyone to attend.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><strong>Anti-virus software</strong></td><td   class=""><p>Network versions of anti-virus software offer features to help the administrators easily set up protection on thousands of computers and to receive notifications of threats as they are detected.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><strong>Network utilities</strong></td><td   class=""><p>Many utilities exist to help run the network, including remote management, which the network administrator can use to control another computer from the IT support centre. This is useful for problem solving and for installing new software or updates, particularly if the network spans a number of locations.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><strong>Office applications</strong></td><td   class=""><p>These help the user become productive. Networks can help you make better use of time and improve quality by sharing documents and configurations. You can store templates for new documents centrally, so every new document you start can be consistent with the documents of other users. Documents can be saved to shared folders, so other users can easily open and edit them for collaborative working.</p></td></tr></tbody><caption>Network software applications</caption></table></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="6437"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNjU5LjY2MS4yODk0LjY0MzcuNjQzOS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTY0Mzk=">Operating system</h3><p>The operating systems in the network connect the computers and users together.

This will be the amount of money that can be spent on the new system.</p><p>To keep within budget, you may need to compromise on equipment that is purchased for the system. For example, you may need to buy cheaper or fewer components than you originally intended.</p><p>There may also be technical constraints due to the hardware and software that are available for the new system. For example, if an IT department has previously invested in particular equipment, you may have to reuse it, rather than buying replacements.</p><span data-type="xref"><root><p>Old equipment can limit the functionality of a new network, due to performance limitations, such as lack of processing power, <span class="highlight"><ref data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMTA2MjAuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRccmVmZXJlbmNlLTEwNjIw" data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNjU5LjY2MS4yODk4LjYxMDYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTYxMDY=" data-type="Key_terms"><text>RAM</text></ref></span> or disk space.</p></root></span><div class="Key_terms" data-id="6106"><h4>Key term</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNjU5LjY2MS4yODk4LjYxMDYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTYxMDY=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE4NS4xODcuNjU5LjY2MS4yODk4LjYxMDYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTYxMDY="><p><span class="highlight">RAM</span> &ndash; Random access memory is used inside every computer to hold programs and data in current use.
