Digital methods of video production allow you to take your footage, cut it up, rearrange it, add sounds, add visual transitions and effects, alter volume and colour levels and generally mix and mould it into the video clip you envisaged. Digital video-editing software allows you to do all this with a high level of control and organisation, and to delete and change it all if you wish.</p><div class="activity" data-id="5639"><h4>Activity 7.2</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU4NC41ODUuMjM1NS41NjM5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01NjM5" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjU4NC41ODUuMjM1NS41NjM5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01NjM5"><p>Gather into a group with your class and ask the question: What should an editor do?</p><p>The editor can be seen as:</p><root><ul><li>someone who works strictly to the demands of the director and places audio and arranges audiovisual assets to meet these demands</li><li>someone who has the creative freedom not only to meet the needs of a director, but also to apply their own creativity to the project and extend the vision of the director</li><li>something in between, arranging the key components as demanded by a director, but also adding their own flair and originality to enhance the video.</li></ul></root><root><ol><li>What is the general consensus among your peers?</li><li>Consider how your view of what an editor should do affects your own approach to the edit process ahead.</li></ol></root></div></div><p>There will be many different ways in which you can edit your footage, but you should remember what is was that you wanted to create at the start of the project, and not change the direction your project at this time.</p></div>
