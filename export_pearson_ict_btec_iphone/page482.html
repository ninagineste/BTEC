You then need to refine your products in line with the findings from your testing and feedback from other people.</p></div>

You should create a simple test plan and list all of the things that you need to test. You can then make notes as you test each of the items. When creating your test plan, consider the following questions:</p><root><ul><li>Will the resolution be good enough on the client&rsquo;s system?
<ul><li>Will it be good enough when printed out?</li><li>Does the resolution support quick download speeds?</li></ul></li><li>Have I put all the assets into compatible file types so that they will work together on the client&rsquo;s system?</li><li>Are the files of an efficient file size for loading and storing on the client&rsquo;s system?</li><li>Is the compression used the maximum possible without distorting the image?</li><li>Do the individual assets within layers and combinations appear with clean edges?</li></ul></root></div>

Other people, such as fellow students, representatives of your client and members of the target audience, are more objective than you will be and can provide useful and constructive feedback.</p><p>A questionnaire is a good way of gaining feedback and so is an interview. Make sure you include enough people to get a good range of feedback and keep a record of the feedback for use in your assessments. Questions to ask could include:</p><root><ul><li>Are the digital graphics of a good quality?</li><li>Is the resolution appropriate for the purpose of the digital graphics in terms of download speeds and print quality?</li><li>Is the final image accurate?
<ul><li>Are all lines and shapes aligned correctly and smoothly?</li><li>Are the vector drawings accurate?</li></ul></li><li>How well do the graphic products meet the needs of the intended audience?</li></ul></root><div class="activity" data-id="3438"><h4>Activity 6.10</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ4MC40ODIuMTM2NS4zNDM4Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0zNDM4" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ4MC40ODIuMTM2NS4zNDM4Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0zNDM4"><p>Obtaining and giving feedback about the work of friends is a good way of understanding what part this plays in final testing.</p><span data-type="xref"><root><ul><li>Get feedback from your fellow learners on your final products (created for <ref data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMTA0NzEuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRccmVmZXJlbmNlLTEwNDcx" data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ3My40NzQuMTgzNC41MDExLjc4OTYuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcY29tcG9zaXRlLTc4OTY=" data-type="assessment_activity"><text>Assessment activity 6.4</text></ref>), either using a questionnaire or by discussing it with them.

You must choose file types that your client can use.</p><p>Exporting will usually involve file compression and you will need to make some decisions about the amount of compression versus image quality. Your ability to do this will depend on the software you are using. Compression will be important to your client depending on what system they will be using to hold the graphics (for example, desktop, laptop, netbook, tablet or mobile phone).</p><div class="assessment_activity" data-id="3985"><h4>Assessment activity 6.5 Maths/1C.5/2C.P5/2C.M4/2C.D3</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ4MC40ODIuMTM3Ni4zOTg1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0zOTg1" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ4MC40ODIuMTM3Ni4zOTg1Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS0zOTg1"><p>Now you are ready to create your product and test it out.</p><span data-type="xref"><root><p>Edit the assets you created in Assessment activities 6.3 and 6.4 to create two graphic products for the set design scenario (see <ref data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMTA2ODcuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRccmVmZXJlbmNlLTEwNjg3" data-elemfid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjY3LjY4LjQ1MS40NTIuMTkwOC41OTExLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS01OTEx" data-type="Image_Document"><text>Figure 6.7</text></ref>): one vector and one bitmap.</p></root></span><root><ul><li>Edit the assets to create your products including text.</li><li>Test the products for functionality, quality and purpose.
