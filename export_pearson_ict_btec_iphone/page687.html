Create a list of the different tasks involved in designing your app and rate your own performance using a scale of 1 (poor performance) to 5 (exceeded own expectations). Be honest, as this type of self-evaluation will help you to identify areas for improvement which will help you on your next project and in the future.</p></div></div></div>

You therefore need to compare each of the requirements for the app against the app itself and produce evidence to show clearly how it meets that requirement.</p><p>One important aspect of the user requirements was defining the intended target audience for your app. You must be able to show how the app appeals to the group of people you identified as your end users.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5542"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjg1LjY4Ny4yMzQ4LjU1NDIuNTU0NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU1NDQ=">Fitness for purpose</h3><p>Within the design brief, you defined the purpose of the app &ndash; what the app is supposed to be able to do. For example, the purpose of the app might be to allow users to watch and comment on videos uploaded by the general public. You now need to make a judgement on whether the purpose you defined has been met, and you must produce evidence to demonstrate this.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5549"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjg1LjY4Ny4yMzQ4LjU1NDkuNTU1MS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU1NTE=">Constraints</h3><p>There are a range of constraints that you defined which could potentially affect your app. For example, this could be the limitations of the programming language chosen, the time given for development, the copyright of the materials being used, or of the mobile phone&rsquo;s capabilities, such as connectivity available (Wi-Fi, 3G) and screen size. You should review your mobile app against these constraints to see how heavily it has been affected by them. Can your device actually run on the hardware available? Did you complete the project within the budget and deadline?</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5556"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjg1LjY4Ny4yMzQ4LjU1NTYuNTU1Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU1NTc=">Quality of the program</h3><p>You should review the quality of your mobile app using the following four criteria: efficiency/performance, maintainability, portability and usability.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="5562"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEwMy4xMDYuNjg1LjY4Ny4yMzQ4LjU1NjIuNTU2My4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTU1NjM=">Strengths and improvements</h3><p>The final part of your review will be to look at the strengths of your mobile app and the improvements that you need to make. These strengths and improvements are likely to come from the earlier stages of your review. The areas you meet very effectively and can produce clear evidence for are your strengths. The areas you need to improve are the stages you cannot produce much evidence for or have not done at all.
