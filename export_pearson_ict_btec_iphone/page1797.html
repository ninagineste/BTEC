They are used for almost every conceivable purpose including business, personal and entertainment purposes. Some of the more common purposes of websites are described in the following sections.</p><div class="level3" data-id="8751"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc1MS44NzUyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODc1Mg==">Presenting information</h3><p>Websites are commonly used both for presenting information, such as news, and for product advertising. Most companies have their own website. Some of the best known news websites are those of BBC News (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news">www.bbc.co.uk/news</a>) and Al Jazeera (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com">www.aljazeera.com</a>).</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8765"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc2NS44NzY2Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODc2Ng==">Storing information</h3><p>Websites can be used to archive information. The &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; concept is a relatively recent development in information storage. It involves using the internet to store information rather than using local storage (such as your computer&rsquo;s disk drive or a USB memory stick).</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8775"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc3NS44Nzc2Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODc3Ng==">Browsing and searching for information</h3><p>The internet search engine Google<sup>&trade;</sup> has become such a part of our lives that the verb &lsquo;to Google<sup>&trade;</sup>&rsquo; has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. If you ask someone a question, you may get the response, &lsquo;Just Google it&rsquo;. The internet has also become a useful source of real-time information. For example, if you are meeting someone at the railway station or airport, the quickest way to check real-time updated information is via the internet.</p><div class="Fact_Box" data-id="10374"><h4>Did you know?</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc3NS4xMDM3NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtMTAzNzQ=" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc3NS4xMDM3NC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtMTAzNzQ="><p>Cloud computing is a relatively new concept, but one that has become very popular. Many influential IT companies have launched cloud services, including Apple<sup>&reg;</sup> with its iCloud<sup>&trade;</sup> service. The iCloud<sup>&trade;</sup> service lets users store all of their music, apps and photos in one central location on the internet.</p></div></div></div><div class="level3" data-id="8778"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODc3OC44Nzc5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODc3OQ==">Improving productivity</h3><p>Email has revolutionised personal and business communication, enabling people to share information and send documents to each other quickly and so improving productivity.

Price comparison websites like Compare the Market<sup>&trade;</sup> (<a href="http://www.comparethemarket.com">www.comparethemarket.com</a>) and Money Supermarket<sup>&trade;</sup> (<a href="http://www.moneysupermarket.com">www.moneysupermarket.com</a>) help people to decide on the most suitable insurance policy, loan or other financial service.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8801"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODgwMS44ODAyLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODgwMg==">Communication with people</h3><p>Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have become very popular as they allow people to communicate with their friends. They can let all their friends know what they are doing with status updates and they are able to chat with friends though an instant messenger type interface. Many other instant messenger services, such as Yahoo<sup>&trade;</sup> Chat<sup>&trade;</sup>, are popular and some include video chatting as well as text chat.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8807"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODgwNy44ODA5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODgwOQ==">Media sharing</h3><p>Another area that the internet has revolutionised is how we listen to music or live radio, and how we watch films. Sites such as Apple<sup>&trade;</sup> iTunes<sup>&trade;</sup> allow consumers to purchase and download music, while sites such as YouTube let people view and share videos on a wide range of subjects. Radio stations now broadcast digitally and so you can listen to them over the internet. Some radio stations are only broadcast digitally such as BBC Radio 6 Music.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8817"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODgxNy44ODE5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODgxOQ==">E-commerce</h3><p>There has also been a huge increase in the number of goods being bought online, both from online-only retailers like Amazon and high street chains, such as Tesco and John Lewis.

You can find information on encyclopaedia websites or specialist websites. Some of these, such as <a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk">www.tomshardware.co.uk</a>, which provides lots of information about PC hardware, give details on training courses and contains video instructions on how to do all sorts of practical things.</p></div><div class="level3" data-id="8838"><h3 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjI0Ni4yNDguMTc5NS4xNzk3LjQ3MzQuODgzOC44ODM5Li1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODgzOQ==">Downloading information</h3><p>Many websites provide digital content for you to download. iTunes<sup>&trade;</sup> is one of the best known websites from which you can buy and download music.
