In an increasingly competitive world, it is also important that companies strive to be productive and not waste time or resources.</li><li><strong>Support decision making.</strong> Managers make decisions all the time. For example, they decide what products to make and/or sell and how to market them and at what price. In order to make good decisions, the managers need good information and this will often come from a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets provide a number of specialist techniques that help the user make decisions. One common technique is scenario modelling. Using this technique users can set up a model of how the situation behaves using equations and then by changing values in some cells, the user can follow the impact of the changes. Other techniques include data mining and goal seeking &ndash; these are described elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Present information clearly and effectively.</strong> Effective presentation of information improves communication between staff, suppliers and customers. Spreadsheets have powerful and flexible tools that can convert volumes of raw numeric data into more easily understood formats such as tables or charts.</li><li><strong>Perform calculations and help with analysing data.</strong> Decision making in organisations may require many complex calculations and then analysis of the data. Spreadsheets break down complex information into more readily understandable forms and have tools to enable data analysis. This allows an organisation to see longer-term trends in buying patterns, for example.</li><li><strong>Manipulate large data sets.</strong> A Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Excel<sup>&reg;</sup> 2010 worksheet has up to 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns and a workbook can have multiple worksheets. This allows it to handle large volumes of data. However, it can require careful design and use of tools to manipulate such large volumes of data.</li></ul></root></div></div><div class="composite"><h2 id="fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEzMC4xMzMuMTI4Mi4xMjgzLjQwNTguNDA2MC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTQwNjA=">Activities where spreadsheets are used</h2><div data-id="4058" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEzMC4xMzMuMTI4Mi4xMjgzLjQwNTguODQ2Ny4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTg0Njc="><p>Using spreadsheets is very helpful in a number of activities.

This is called cost modelling. Using a spreadsheet in this way is also known as &lsquo;what if&rsquo; analysis or goal seeking. The process involves changing values in particular cells and seeing the change this has to values in all related cells.</li><li><strong>Analysis of large data sets.</strong> Spreadsheets are frequently used to analyse large sets of data, such as the results gathered during scientific experiments or large market research exercises. The format of the data to be gathered can be designed so that it can be directly imported into a spreadsheet model, ready to be analysed. The spreadsheet&rsquo;s ability to perform many calculations very quickly but also accurately is key.</li><li><strong>Tracking progress and recording results.</strong> Many teachers use spreadsheets to track learners&rsquo; progress and record their marks. Some more complex functions such as IF statements can be used to flag up learners who are making good progress or those who may need extra help to reach their target grades.</li><li><strong>Creating timetables and results.</strong> Spreadsheets are often used to create timetables or fixture lists for sports clubs so that the information is clearly presented in tables. The spreadsheet can also perform calculations, such as work out points awarded and identify averages and goal differences. The information can be sorted to produce, for example, a league table, which someone in the club can easily update each week to show current league positions.</li><li><strong>Stock control.</strong> Small shops can use spreadsheets to control their stock. The number of items delivered by the manufacturers is entered into the spreadsheet model. When items are sold, the number of items in stock is decreased. The spreadsheet model can use IF statements to check if there are enough items left in stock. If the stock level is running low, the spreadsheet can warn the shopkeeper to order more.</li></ul></root></div><div class="activity" data-id="8479"><h4>Activity 9.1</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEzMC4xMzMuMTI4Mi4xMjgzLjQwNTguODQ3OS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODQ3OQ==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEzMC4xMzMuMTI4Mi4xMjgzLjQwNTguODQ3OS4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtODQ3OQ=="><div data-id="8479" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjEzMC4xMzMuMTI4Mi4xMjgzLjQwNTguODQ3OS44NDgxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtODQ4MQ=="><p>A local fast-food outlet has asked you to conduct a survey of people&rsquo;s food and drink preferences.
