Together with my partner, we manage the whole business, but we do have some sales assistants who work for us at busy times. It is a franchise and most of the systems and procedures were provided to us when we set up the business. Each of us has focused on different aspects of the business. One of my roles is to manage the IT work &ndash; particularly the databases. We were given some blank databases at the start and some training to help learn how to use them. However, over time I have developed some new databases and also adapted the standard ones to give us more functionality and better reports.</p></div><div data-id="2988" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE1OS4xNjAuMTAxMC4xMDExLjI5ODguNjk1OC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTY5NTg="><p>The vast majority of my time on the databases is spent as a user &ndash; simply entering data or running reports. But occasionally, when I know the shop will be quiet, I take the time to look for improvements and added functionality &ndash; mostly by designing new queries and reports that we think will help us understand the business better. I have also added an extra field to the customer database that identifies the poor payers. This is quite useful now and I thought it would be easy to do, but in the end it was a lot of work to chase down all of the changes that needed doing to other objects to make it actually work!</p></div><div data-id="2988" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE1OS4xNjAuMTAxMC4xMDExLjI5ODguNjk2My4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFx0ZXh0LTY5NjM="><p>The change that I am most proud of is when I added a menu system to the main database. I did this using a series of buttons on a menu form. The menu has made a huge difference to how easy it is to use the database. One additional benefit that I only realised later was that it restricted my partner&rsquo;s access to the underlying queries and reports &ndash; he had a tendency to &lsquo;tinker&rsquo; with them and sometimes caused problems.</p></div><div class="think" data-id="6968"><h4>Think about it</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE1OS4xNjAuMTAxMC4xMDExLjI5ODguNjk2OC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtNjk2OA==" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE1OS4xNjAuMTAxMC4xMDExLjI5ODguNjk2OC4tbW9kZWxzXGNvcmVcZWxlbWVudFxjb21wb3NpdGUtNjk2OA=="><div data-id="6968" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjE1OS4xNjAuMTAxMC4xMDExLjI5ODguNjk2OC42OTczLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XHRleHQtNjk3Mw=="><root><ol><li>What problems might Mary encounter when she does want to change forms and tables or add functionality?
