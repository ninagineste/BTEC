Strength of light, colour and shadows are all tools that a director has to set the scene they want.
<br />Natural light can look fantastic on film, but it is often impractical &ndash; you can&rsquo;t ask an actor to look in the direction of the sun too long. Using additional light sources gives you a lot of control over illumination within your video, but can easily appear too strong or artificial.</p></root></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Ambient noise</p></td><td   class=""><p>Background noise can be used to add atmosphere to a scene (such as in caf&eacute;s, at events, or on the street) but can also ruin the final sound of your film. The key question is whether it will prevent the audience hearing the dialogue (or any other sound) that you want them to hear.<br />The choice of equipment will greatly affect this &ndash; many built-in microphones will pick up all sound from a range of directions, so you may need a targeted or directional external microphone to focus on the dialogue.<br />You may consider dubbing sound in afterwards, re-recording speech or taking a separate sound recording of an environment and layering the soundtracks on top of each other so that you can control the levels and effects of each.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Weather</p></td><td   class=""><p>Exterior scenes can be interesting and unusual, but they are constantly under the threat of the weather at that particular time. Rain is not the only threat; strong sunlight, wind, snowy or frozen ground and fog can all prevent you from shooting.<br />Using weather reports can help you predict when and where you will be able to shoot, but it is also worth having a backup plan just in case an unexpected rainy day ruins your plans.<br />Rather than lose the planned shooting time (as you may have borrowed equipment and specialist talent may have given up their time), you may choose to shoot an interior scene rather than waste the day altogether.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Transport</p></td><td   class=""><p>Can you safely and efficiently get all of your crew and equipment to the location, ready to shoot at the same time? Can you get everyone and everything back to where they need to be at the end of the day?<br />Clever use of interiors or stages may be the answer if the answer to either of these questions is no.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Security</p></td><td   class=""><p>Video/film shoots, no matter how large or small, attract attention. Whether it is due to the equipment, the lights, the actors or the action itself, people are always interested when they see people using a camera. <br />You must make sure that your chosen location allows you and your crew to work without any threat of other people disrupting your filming and being a threat to the project or the team working on it.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Legalities</p></td><td   class=""><root><p>There are two key legal considerations you need to consider.
</p><ol><li>Does the location have any health and safety issues that could have legal implications? For example, a crew member injured because of a slippery floor may make a claim against the production company.</li><li>Does the location allow filming? Many locations, including public buildings, shopping centres and colleges/universities, will want to know what you are using the location for before they allow you to start filming. They can stop you publishing a video if you haven&rsquo;t obtained the correct permission.</li></ol></root></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Safety and hazards</p></td><td   class=""><p>If you want to use a busy environment, question how safe you are all going to be. This is particularly important when the environment is your subject and you need something specific within it, such as buildings or streets. You may need to capture an image of a moving tram or bus, but if getting a close-up shot puts you at risk and makes filming unsafe, you may have to look at alternative safer options such as filming it at a distance or when it is stationary.<br />At no point should your film be more important than the people working on it. A good recce will make sure that no-one will feel unsafe during the filming process.</p></td></tr><tr><td   class=""><p>Indoor/outdoor</p></td><td   class=""><p>How you approach and plan for an indoor scene will be different from how you approach and plan an outdoor scene. Be sure to think about how much equipment you have and how it fits in the available space, as well as about whether the indoor or outdoor location may cause you problems. The more issues with the location you can plan for in advance or avoid, the better prepared you will be on the day.</p></td></tr></tbody><caption>Considerations when planning a video shoot</caption></table></div></div><div class="Checklist" data-id="6051"><h4>Just checking</h4><div class="tip_content" data-fid="MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzNy41MzguMjYwMy42MDUxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS02MDUx" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzNy41MzguMjYwMy42MDUxLi1tb2RlbHNcY29yZVxlbGVtZW50XGNvbXBvc2l0ZS02MDUx"><div data-id="6051" class="content" id="anchor_fid_MS40Ljk5Mi4xMDQ3LjEwNDkuMS4yLjgwLjgzLjUzNy41MzguMjYwMy42MDUxLjYwNTQuLW1vZGVsc1xjb3JlXGVsZW1lbnRcdGV4dC02MDU0"><root><ol><li>Name the three types of location and give an example of each.</li><li>State three ways in which you could manage ambient noise when recording at an external location.</li></ol></root></div></div></div></div></div>
